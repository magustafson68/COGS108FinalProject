    "Staying physically active is one of the best ways to ensure a healthy lifestyle and avoid certain illnesses. However, as more people shift from more physically demanding jobs to those that can accomplished simply by sitting at a desk, coupled with the rise of technology keeping us in one place and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forcing many people to stay indoors most of the time, it is certainly possible that modern lifestyle changes are consequently increasing the average person’s risk of debilitating illnesses such as cardiovascular (CV) disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the topic of sedentary living, the New York State Department of Health reports that people are at least 30-50% more likely to experience high blood pressure if they do not exercise regularly [1]. The risk factor of inactivity for CV disease is now becoming as high as the risk factor of smoking, given that in the United States, twice as many adults are inactive compared to adults smoking. As health advisories against harmful substances like cigarettes reduce the rate of risky behaviors such as smoking, could that inadvertently be leaving the issue of inactivity unaddressed with regards to rates of CV disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the topic of career paths in relation to CV disease, the CDC has shown that people working in blue-collar, service-oriented jobs such as wholesale, transportation, utilities, etc, were more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke compared to those in white-collar jobs such as finance, science, education, etc [2]. However, the CDC also reported the difference in CV disease rates between employed and unemployed people and found that unemployed people were 32% more likely to experience heart disease compared to people employed in a single occupation. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of remote learning/work due to the pandemic, the sedentary lifestyle is now being linked to our very careers in greater spades than ever before. Amidst the conveniences that remote work can provide with regards to commuting, schedule flexibility, etc, could this new shift in our work behaviors possibly be making us at greater risk for CV disease?\n",

    "*As all of our data is anonymized, we do not anticipate any privacy issues with our data set. We’re hoping to find a dataset with a fairly evenly distributed population (not just a particular age group or ethnic group), but there are always potential biases that cannot be avoided. We will attempt to identify these biases by both looking at the data’s origins and by analyzing the contents of the data set itself, in order to identify potential biases. The data will likely be biased toward more developed countries, as data of this sort is not often available from less developed (or developing) countries. We are hoping that this data will generalize to the larger group of developed countries as a whole, with a fair distribution of different ethnicities and ages.*"
