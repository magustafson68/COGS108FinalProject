    "Our second dataset was also already in a .csv format, so it was tidy from the start. However, the data did have to be cleaned up to get some extraneous data removed. First and foremost, observations were listed for the United States as a whole, then broken down by city for each state, then broken down by census tract for each city. We decided to only include city and state data in our observations, so we removed any rows that had information for the US as a whole or for specific census tracts. These observations were then broken down into Crude-Adjusted rates (which are influenced by underlying age distribution of the population) and Age-Adjusted rates (which are independent of age distributions of the population) for coronary heart disease. We decided to only focus on age-adjusted rates so that cities/states with an older population wouldnâ€™t make the data biased in their favor. Finally, we removed any columns that had information not necessary to the analysis at hand, such as IDs used to identify certain cities and states when their names were already included in the dataset. We ended up with a dataset containing 500 rows and 11 columns, with each row representing a cityâ€™s rate of coronary heart disease for adults aged 18+."
