# Final Project for COGS 108: Data Science in Practice
## Spring Quarter 2020, University of California, San Diego

This project was a collaborative effort with four other team members in my COGS 108 data science course at UCSD in Spring 2020. Our research focused on analyzing how different factors and lifestyle chocies play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease, and the rate of these disease in different regions of the United States. 

Using logistic regression, we found that when considering all potential risk factors in a person's life, blood pressure, age, and cholesterol levels were the most positively correlated with whether or not a person suffered from cardiovascular disease. As a result, those regions of the country with higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels and a generally older populace were more likely to have outstanding rates of cardiovascular disease.
